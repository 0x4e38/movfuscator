M/o/Vfuscator 2.0 crackme
github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator

Goal:
  Find the key.

Details:
  A simple 15 line crackme in C, compiled with the M/o/Vfuscator2.  

Issues:
  M/o/Vfuscator2 still uses a cmp/je for external calls, and some control flow
  details are leaked through .text section references in the mov instructions.
  Stack details are still revealed through ebp/esp references.  All will be
  fixed shortly.
