M/o/Vfuscator 2.0 crackme2
github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator

Goal:
  Find the key.

Details:
  A simple 15 line crackme in C, compiled with the M/o/Vfuscator2.

  Same as crackme1, but with a new key and a constant time strcmp.  Should
  prevent the easiest solutions to crackme1.

Issues:
  M/o/Vfuscator2 still uses a cmp/je for external calls.  Stack details are
  still revealed through ebp/esp references.  All will be fixed shortly.
